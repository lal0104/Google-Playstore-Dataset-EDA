So for this we did an analysis as you know from that we can say that the games based on action, casual and arcade are doing better than others. Going with this genres will be beneficial for app and company also.<br>
3. Paid or Free : After choosing category and genre now we need to decide whether we wanna go with free or paid version of our app. So as we all know, to reach maximum users we must keep our app free. But due to any complication you have in business, you want to keep it paid, then by analyzing the data we can say that people are more interested in paying for Family and Game categorized applications. So going with games and family will be the best option for paid application.<br>
4. Price : If you decided to bring a paid app then the main concern will be what should be a price for your application. From analyzing the data we can say that most people are paying around 1 to 10 USD. After analyzing data in depth for 1 to 10 USD we found out that the best suitable range for any application will be between 2.30 USD to 6.00 USD.
